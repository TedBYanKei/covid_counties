# covid_counties

The purpose of this program and its outputs are for academic purposes only.

The program makes use of covid fatality information by day, along with US Census information by county information joined 
in to show fatalities by date over time.
It outputs a number of chloropleth maps, and then stitches them together via ImageMagick.
